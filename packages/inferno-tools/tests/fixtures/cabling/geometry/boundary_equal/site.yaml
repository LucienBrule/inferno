# Boundary equal test fixture - distance exactly at dac_max_m
# With tile_m=1.0, slack_factor=1.2, dac_max_m=3.0
# Need base distance = 3.0/1.2 = 2.5m
# Manhattan distance of 2.5 tiles: use (0,0) to (2,0) + (0,0.5) â‰ˆ 2.5
# Simplified: use (0,0) to (2,1) = 3 tiles = 3.0m base, 3.6m with slack (over threshold)
# Better: use custom tile_m to get exact boundary
# (0,0) to (2,0) = 2 tiles, with tile_m=1.25 gives 2.5m base, 3.0m with slack
