  - Confirm `circle-<n>` rack ID matches physical position.

## 4. Installation Steps

1. **Frame Assembly**  
   - Install rail kits, cable management arms, shelves.
2. **PDU & Power**  
   - Mount `inferno-pdu-circle<n>-1`, route input cable to NEMA outlet.
3. **Network Cabling**  
   - Terminate patch cables to `panel-circle-<n>`, label per port.
4. **HVAC Integration**  
   - Secure containment lid, attach duct fan to manifold flange.
5. **Component Fixtures**  
   - Slide in servers, storage units, mezzanine cards.
6. **Grounding & Bonding**
