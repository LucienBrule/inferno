# EPIC: Implement Cabling Calculation

## Epic Purpose

The purpose of this epic is to develop and integrate a comprehensive cabling calculation feature within the system. This
functionality will enable accurate computation of cable lengths and configurations based on project requirements,
ensuring efficient and reliable cabling design.

## Intent

This epic aims to deliver a staged rollout of the cabling calculation capability, starting from data loading and
preprocessing, followed by the core calculation logic, validation of results, visualization of cabling layouts, and
concluding with thorough testing to guarantee robustness and correctness. Each stage will be developed as a discrete
task to facilitate incremental progress and continuous integration.

## Task List

- TASK.cabling.loader  
  Implement data loaders for cabling inputs, including project specifications, cable types, and routing information.

- TASK.cabling.calculation  
  Develop the core cabling calculation algorithms to determine cable lengths, routing paths, and necessary
  configurations.

- TASK.cabling.validation  
  Create validation routines to verify the accuracy and consistency of cabling calculation results against project
  constraints.

- TASK.cabling.visualization  
  Build visualization tools to graphically represent cabling layouts and calculation outcomes for review and analysis.

- TASK.cabling.tests  
  Design and execute comprehensive unit and integration tests covering all aspects of the cabling calculation feature to
  ensure quality and reliability.
